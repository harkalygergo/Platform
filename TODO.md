# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Make `ROLE_USER` as default role for new users with `Version20241228223729` commented functions, currently it causes error with `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
` on server

## Medium Priority
- [ ] `doctrine:schema:validate` command returns `DROP TABLE doctrine_migration_versions;` error, it is a common issue with Symfony

## Low Priority
